        <h1>One Web/Mobile First Responsive Boilerplate</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>The One Web Front-end Boilerplate is a modular framework for building responsive 
websites with <strong>Apache Server Side Includes</strong> (<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/ssi.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/ssi.html</a>), 
<strong>SMACSS</strong> (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS, <a href="http://smacss.com/">http://smacss.com/</a>), 
<strong>Sass</strong> preprocessor (<a href="http://sass-lang.com/">http://sass-lang.com/</a>), and <strong>RequireJS</strong> (<a href="http://requirejs.org/">http://requirejs.org/</a>). </p>

<p><strong>Demo:</strong> Optimized Styleguide Page: <a href="http://akikoo.github.com/one-web-boilerplate/publish/html-compressed/pages/styleguide/index.html">http://akikoo.github.com/one-web-boilerplate/publish/html-compressed/pages/styleguide/index.html</a>.</p>

<p>This boilerplate draws code from many other projects, combining various solutions 
into a custom, modular, and responsive front-end build framework. It's packed with 
goodies, building on many of the industry best practices found in the resources 
listed under Credits. The project also includes Ant build script that runs code 
quality tools against JavaScript and CSS files, minifying and concatenating them 
at the end of the process. </p>

<p>The One Web Boilerplate works well for me which is why I'm publishing it 
here for you to use and improve. It basically extends popular boilerplates, including 
320 and Up (<a href="https://github.com/malarkey/320andup/">https://github.com/malarkey/320andup/</a>), HTML5 Boilerplate (<a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">http://html5boilerplate.com/</a>), 
Mobile Boilerplate (<a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/">http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/</a>), ZURB Foundation (<a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">http://foundation.zurb.com/</a>), 
Twitter Bootstrap (<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/</a>), and many others, with 
Server Side Includes. The framework can easily be plugged into Continuous Integration 
solutions, such as Jenkins: <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org">http://jenkins-ci.org</a>. </p>

<p>This framework doesn't include any grid. You decide how you build your site. 
However, if you need a grid, have a look at the Fluid Grid that supports both 
Sass (SCSS) and LESS CSS: <a href="http://akikoo.github.com/Fluid-Grid/">http://akikoo.github.com/Fluid-Grid/</a>. Sass/Compass is 
used by default, both in One Web Boilerplate and the Fluid Grid. </p>

<h2>File structure</h2>

<h3>There are two main directories: /build and /webroot.</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>/build contains Ant build script and all the tools you need to make your 
frontend build. Common build properties are defined in /build/config/project.properties. 
There's also a folder called masterpage, which is used as a blueprint for creating new pages. </p></li>
<li><p>/webroot contains two subdirectories: /assets and /html. </p></li>
<li><p>/webroot/assets contains all the Sass and LESS files, stylesheets, JavaScript files and 
theme images. </p></li>
<li><p>/webroot/html contains all the HTML files, generated by Apache Server Side Includes. 
HTML properties are defined in /webroot/config.shtml.</p></li>
</ul><p>Dev files are in /webroot/assets and /webroot/html.
Optimised files are in /build/publish/assets and /build/publish/html.</p>

</ul><h2>Environment setup</h2>

<h3>Apache Ant</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Whether you're on Windows or Mac, you'll need the Java Development Kit (JDK) 
(at least version 1.4). You can download it here: 
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>. 
If you're not sure which version of the JDK you have, run the command 
java -version in the terminal.</p></li>
<li><p>Download Apache Ant here (on Mac OSX it's usually already installed): 
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi">http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi</a>. On Windows, it's probably best to extract 
the contents of the zip to C:\ant.</p></li>
<li><p>See this article for how to finish the installation on your platform:
<a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/automate-your-projects-with-apache-ant/">http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/automate-your-projects-with-apache-ant/</a> 
(see section Windows- and Mac-Specific Install Bits.)</p></li>
</ul><h3>Apache SSI</h3>

<p>To permit SSI on your server, see this article: 
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/ssi.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/ssi.html</a></p>

<h3>Ruby (you need this if you use Sass/Compass)</h3>

<p>On OS X, you'll already have Ruby installed. On Windows, see <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/</a>. 
For installing Sass, see <a href="http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html">http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html</a>. For installing Compass, 
see <a href="http://compass-style.org/install/">http://compass-style.org/install/</a>. You should use it, it's awesome. </p>

<p>All the other tools needed in the local build are in the tools folder.</p>

<h3>Build configuration</h3>

<p>After Apache Ant, SSI, Ruby, Sass and Compass setup, you need to do two more things 
to configure the build:</p>

<ol>
<li>In /build/config/project.properties, look for 'web.home' in line number 124. 
Change the path to your local directory.</li>
<li>In that same file, look for 'web.url' in line number 126. Create an Apache 
virtualhost that points to the location you defined for 'web.home' above. </li>
</ol><p>If you get the "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space" error during the build 
on OS X (I did), try running this in your terminal: export ANT_OPTS=-XX:MaxPermSize=256m</p>

<p>You should now be up and running with both the environment and the local build. </p>

<h2>Things you need to know</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A CSS preprocessor, either Sass (<a href="http://sass-lang.com/">http://sass-lang.com/</a>), default option with 
Compass (<a href="http://compass-style.org/">http://compass-style.org/</a>), or LESS (<a href="http://lesscss.org/">http://lesscss.org/</a>) is used 
to compile the stylesheets. If you don't want to use a preprocessor, you can 
of course work with the CSS files directly. By default, it's assumed that you 
compile Sass or LESS files on your local machine, and let the build process 
do the CSSLint check on your generated CSS files. (There are tasks for Sass 
and LESS processing in /build/build.xml, namely &lt;css.compile.sass /&gt; and 
&lt;css.compile.less /&gt; macrodef calls, but they are commented out.) 
To compile CSS files on your local machine, type one of the following commands 
in the terminal (replace the '{pathtoworkingcopy}' with your local path):</p>

<p>a) using Sass:
   sass --watch /{pathtoworkingcopy}/webroot/assets/scss:/{pathtoworkingcopy}/webroot/assets/css</p>

<p>b) using Compass with Sass:
   compass watch /{pathtoworkingcopy}/webroot/assets</p>

<p>For more info, see Sass and Compass documentation. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Media Queries are based on 16px default font size and defined in ems. 
The framework is designed to be modular so you should split the rules 
into logical modules, and place the styles in /webroot/assets/scss/components/modules. 
For more info on how to categorize your CSS, see SMACSS: <a href="http://smacss.com/">http://smacss.com/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript should not be relied on for layout. That's why I've adopted a 
bulletproof solution from Nicholas Zakas and Tantek Çelik: 
<a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2011/03/22/using-html5-semantic-elements-today/">http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2011/03/22/using-html5-semantic-elements-today/</a> 
and <a href="http://tantek.com/presentations/2010/11/html5-now/">http://tantek.com/presentations/2010/11/html5-now/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't use IDs in CSS selectors. Use classes, or ARIA landmark roles instead 
(referenced with CSS attribute selectors). See also <a href="http://oli.jp/2011/ids/">http://oli.jp/2011/ids/</a>.</p></li>
</ul><h2>Logic</h2>

<h3>HTML</h3>

<ul>
<li>Each page has a controller in /webroot/html/pages/pagename/index.shtml. 
In that file, we include the config file and set variables, define the view, 
and template file that we need to include, to render that particular page. 
For more information, see project main index file: 
<a href="https://github.com/akikoo/one-web-boilerplate/blob/master/webroot/html/index.shtml">https://github.com/akikoo/one-web-boilerplate/blob/master/webroot/html/index.shtml</a>.</li>
</ul><h3>CSS - A number of stylesheets by default, compiled and imported by Sass, included in the following order:</h3>

<ul>
<li>/webroot/assets/css/common/normalize.css (third-party reset styles)</li>
<li>/webroot/assets/scss/common/elements.scss (global, mobile first styles, containing only 
common colour and typographic rules for basic experience to all users)</li>
<li>/webroot/assets/scss/common/utilities.scss (helper styles from HTML5 Boilerplate and 
HTML5 Mobile Boilerplate)</li>
<li>/webroot/assets/scss/common/base.scss (base stylesheet that imports the above 
mentioned three stylesheets)</li>
<li>/webroot/assets/scss/components/layout.scss (page layout rules)</li>
<li>/webroot/assets/scss/components/module.scss (module base stylesheet that imports all the modules)</li>
<li>/webroot/assets/scss/components/state.scss (state rules for layout and modules)</li>
<li>/webroot/assets/scss/components/theme.scss (theme styles)</li>
<li>/webroot/assets/scss/main.scss (layout with Media Queries for responsive, 
enhanced design for smartphones, tablets and larger screens)</li>
<li>/webroot/assets/scss/main-ie.scss (layout without Media Queries for legacy 
IE 6/7/8 browsers). </li>
</ul><p>Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS (SMACSS, <a href="http://smacss.com/">http://smacss.com/</a>) is used by default. 
main.scss and main-ie.scss are the main stylesheets that <a href="https://github.com/import" class="user-mention">@import</a> all the common styles. 
Note that styles are @import-ed only for development. For production, the build script 
inlines and minifies styles in the same order that you @import-ed them. Nice, eh? 
But keep in mind that you have to <a href="https://github.com/import" class="user-mention">@import</a> the core styles (see above) before anything else. </p>

<p>Remember that if you work with Sass, you should only do changes in /webroot/assets/scss/ 
directory, as the files in /webroot/assets/css/ will obviously be the generated ones, 
rewritten on each save. </p>

<p>New stylesheets you create should be placed in /webroot/assets/scss/components/modules. 
Remember to add <a href="https://github.com/import" class="user-mention">@import</a> rules for any new styles. After the base styles, the order 
in which the module stylesheets are included should't matter (you write your styles 
carefully, right?) The idea is that module styles inherit only from base rules, not 
from other modules. </p>

<p>config.rb file in /assets is used for passing compile options to Compass. By default 
you don't need to touch that file. If you want to edit it, see Compass documentation. </p>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

<ul>
<li>Third-party plugins are included in /webroot/assets/js/lib. Custom scripts are 
in /webroot/assets/js/modules. Dependancies are managed by RequireJS (<a href="http://requirejs.org/">http://requirejs.org/</a>), 
a script loader that supports AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) API. Script paths 
and their dependencies are defined in /webroot/assets/js/config.js. Scripts are 
imported in /webroot/assets/js/main.js. In the optimized script bundle, almond.js 
(<a href="https://github.com/jrburke/almond">https://github.com/jrburke/almond</a>) is used in place of require.js, to package 
everything in just one script file. </li>
</ul><h2>Ant build process</h2>

<h3>To build your project, do the following</h3>

<p>This assumes you've set up the build, as explained in Build configuration.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open terminal and go to /path_to_your_project/build </li>
<li>Run ant -buildfile build.xml</li>
</ol><h3>The sequence of events is then as follows:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Old build directory called /publish is deleted</li>
<li>/publish directory is recreated, and build timestamps are added as text files</li>
<li>HTML header and footer files are edited, to include minified and concatenated 
assets, created during the build</li>
<li>SHTML snippets are called to generate full HTML web pages</li>
<li>SHTML snippets are called to generate HTML modules </li>
<li>SHTML file extensions are changed to HTML and all pages are copied to 
build/publish/html. Compressed HTML versions are copied to 
build/publish/html-compressed</li>
<li>Component, module, page and template lists are generated, to be included in 
the project root index page</li>
<li>HTML header and footer files are reverted, to include separate assets again 
(we'll continue developing!)</li>
<li>CSSLint tool is run against all CSS files (however excluding third-party stylesheets)</li>
<li>JSHint tool is run against JavaScript code (excluding third-party scripts)</li>
<li>JSDoc documentation is created and placed in build/publish/docs/jsdocs</li>
<li>CSS files are concatenated by inlining all @import-ed styles, producing two 
files: main.css and main-ie.css (one with and one without Media 
Queries). This way, we can keep the CSS rules separate from the actual Media 
Queries. Both files are then minified and placed in build/publish/assets/css. </li>
<li>JavaScript files are minified and concatenated and placed in 
/build/publish/assets/js/lib (currently only Modernizr and require.js.) 
Note that compiled require.js contains the original require.js and all the 
modules, loaded with almond require/define shim.</li>
<li>Unoptimised images are copied to /build/publish/assets/img</li>
<li>Temporary directory that was used during the build is deleted</li>
<li>That's it!</li>
</ol><p>Congratulations! You now have a brand new /build/publish directory that has the 
following four directories: </p>

<ul>
<li>HTML files (/build/publish/html), </li>
<li>Compressed HTML files (/build/publish/html-compressed), </li>
<li>Minified and concatenated CSS and JS files (/build/publish/assets), and </li>
<li>JSDoc documentation (/build/publish/docs/jsdocs). </li>
</ul><p>You can now deploy the site using your favourite Continuous Integration server. 
It could be Jenkins (<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org">http://jenkins-ci.org</a>) or Bamboo 
(<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/">http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/</a>). You decide. </p>

<p>Please note that the earlier version of this framework that uses the Yahoo YUI 
compressor is tagged here: <a href="https://github.com/akikoo/one-web-boilerplate/tags">https://github.com/akikoo/one-web-boilerplate/tags</a>. 
Nowadays I prefer this framework to use RequireJS with an optimizer that manages 
dependencies in a much easier way. </p>

<p>Another note: I prefer Sass preprocessor nowadays because it's more powerful 
(especially with Compass) and because it's actively maintained and developed. 
This means that I'm not anymore actively maintaining the LESS files in this 
framework. Just wanted to let you know. However do let me know if you have any 
LESS issues so I can try to fix them (I'd be more up for it if I knew someone out 
there was still using LESS with this framework...).</p>

<p>One more thing: you should obviously exclude /build/publish directory from version 
control because that directory is cleaned up and recreated on each build. 
No need to track changes to that.</p>

<h2>To-Do:</h2>
