/**
 * 
 * Modular styles for browsers that don't support Media Queries 
 * This means legacy IE 6/7/8
 * 
 * Alternatively, this file could be used to build an old-school non-responsive 
 * website, where the @import-ed stylesheets could be various standalone modules 
 * on the page. You decide, it obviously depends on the project.
 *
 * These enhance and sometimes override the primary (mobile first) styles.
 * Layout styles (width, float etc.) and styles for extra elements.
 * 
 * We are @import-ing the same stylesheets than for more capable browsers, but 
 * this time without Media Queries. Media Queries are stripped out during the 
 * build process. This way, we can serve less capable browsers a mid-screen sized 
 * desktop version. The minified version of this file is served with conditional 
 * comments for IE (or for all browsers if it's a one-size-fits-all kind of project).

  (B) Standalone modules instead, if you prefer that way. 

  This file is served to browsers that don't support Media Queries, so you may 
  decide to reuse the above stylesheets under css/mq-overlap/*, or include your 
  own modular ones here
