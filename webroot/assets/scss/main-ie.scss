 * 
 * Modular styles for browsers that don't support Media Queries 
 * This means legacy IE 6/7/8
 * 
 * Alternatively, this file could be used to build an old-school non-responsive 
 * website, where the @import-ed stylesheets could be various standalone modules 
 * on the page. You decide, it obviously depends on the project.
 *
 * These enhance and sometimes override the primary (mobile first) styles.
 * Layout styles (width, float etc.) and styles for extra elements.
 * 
 * We are @import-ing the same stylesheets than for more capable browsers, but 
 * this time without Media Queries. Media Queries are stripped out during the 
 * build process. This way, we can serve less capable browsers a mid-screen sized 
 * desktop version. The minified version of this file is served with conditional 
 * comments for IE (or for all browsers if it's a one-size-fits-all kind of project).
