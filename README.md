# One Web/Mobile First Responsive Boilerplate


## What is it? 

The One Web Frontend Boilerplate is a modular framework for building responsive 
websites with Apache Server Side Includes: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/ssi.html.

It draws code from many other projects, combining various solutions into a custom, 
modular frontend framework (please see Credits section below). The project also 
includes Ant build script that runs code quality tools against JavaScript and 
CSS files, minifying and concatenating them at the end of the process. 

There's nothing really new in this boilerplate, but it works well for me which is 
why I'm publishing it here for you to use and improve. It builds on many of the 
best practices found in the resources listed under Credits. It basically extends 
popular boilerplates with Server Side Includes. The goal is to achieve a modular 
and responsive frontend build environment, following industry best practices. 
The framework can easily be plugged into Continuous Integration solutions, 
such as Jenkins: http://jenkins-ci.org. 


## File structure

### There are two main directories: /build and /webroot.

* /build contains Ant build script and all the tools you need to make your 
	frontend build. Default and common build properties are defined in 
	/build/config/default.properties. Project-specific properties are defined in 
	/build/config/project.properties.

* /webroot contains two subdirectories: /assets and /html. 

* /webroot/assets contains all the stylesheets, JavaScript files and theme images. 

* /webroot/html contains all the HTML files, generated by Apache Server Side Includes. 
	HTML properties are defined in /webroot/config.shtml.

Dev files are in /webroot/assets and /webroot/html.
Optimised files are in /build/publish/assets and /build/publish/html.


## Build tools

* Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)
* Ant-Contrib Tasks (http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/)
* YUI Compressor (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/)
* Rhino (http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/)
* JSLint (http://www.jslint.com/)
* JSHint (http://www.jshint.com/)
* CSSLint (http://csslint.net/)
* HTML Compressor (http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/)
* JSDoc Toolkit (http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/)
* OptiPNG http://optipng.sourceforge.net/
* jpegtran http://www.ijg.org/


## Things you need to know

* Media Queries are based on 16px default font size and defined in ems. 
	If you don't go for responsive design (you should!), just remove 
	/webroot/assets/css/responsive.css. The framework is designed to be modular 
	so you should split the rules into logical modules, and place the styles in 
	/webroot/assets/css/modules. 

* JavaScript should not be relied on for layout. That's why I've adopted a 
	bulletproof solution from Nicholas Zakas and Tantek Çelik: 
	http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2011/03/22/using-html5-semantic-elements-today/, 
	http://tantek.com/presentations/2010/11/html5-now/.

* Don’t use IDs in CSS selectors. Use classes, or ARIA landmark roles instead 
	(referenced with CSS attribute selectors). See also http://oli.jp/2011/ids/.

* CSSLint is currently not used. I find it way too strict and it's still buggy 
	(it complains about Media Queries, for example). I'll plug it in the build 
	script once these issues have been resolved. (Ideas about how to remove 
	selected rules?)

* I'm using Sticky footer solution: http://www.cssstickyfooter.com.


## Logic

### HTML
* Each page has a controller in /webroot/html/pages/pagename/index.shtml. 
	In that file, we include the config file and set variables, define the view, 
	and template file that we need to include, to render that particular page.

### CSS - five stylesheets by default, included in the following order: 
* /webroot/assets/css/normalize.css (reset styles)
* /webroot/assets/css/base.css (global, mobile first styles, containing only 
	common colour and typographic rules for basic experience to all users)
* /webroot/assets/css/responsive.css (layout with Media Queries for responsive, 
	enhanced design for smartphones, tablets and larger screens)
* /webroot/assets/css/utilities.css (helper styles from HTML5 Boilerplate and 
	HTML5 Mobile Boilerplate)
* /webroot/assets/css/ie/ie6.1.1.css (Universal IE6 styles, not concatenated 
	with other styles)

Any other stylesheets you create should be placed in /webroot/assets/css/modules. 
Remember to update references in /html/components/document_head.shtml. After the 
base styles, the order in which the module stylesheets are included should't 
matter (you write your styles carefully, right?) The idea is that module styles 
inherit only from base rules, not from other modules. 

### JavaScript
* Third-party plugins are included in /webroot/assets/js/lib. Custom scripts are 
in /webroot/assets/js.

## Ant build process

### To build your project, do the following:

1. Open /build/config/project.properties and update the settings under Local 
setup, to match your local development environment.
2. Open terminal and go to /one-web-boilerplate/build 
3. Run ant -buildfile build.xml

### The sequence of events is then as follows: 

1. Old build directory called /publish is deleted
2. /publish directory is recreated, and build timestamps are added as text files
3. HTML header and footer files are updated, to include minified and concatenated 
	assets, created during the build
4. SHTML snippets are called to generate full web pages
5. SHTML file extensions are changed to HTML and all pages are copied to 
	build/publish/html. Compressed HTML versions are copied to 
	build/publish/html-compressed
6. CSS and JS files are copied to a temporary folder for manipulation, flattening 
	folders
7. Unoptimised images are copied to /build/publish/assets/img
8. CSS files are minified and concatenated, and placed in build/publish/assets/css
9. JSLint or JSHint tool (you decide which one) is run against JavaScript code
10. JSDoc documentation is created and placed in build/publish/docs/jsdocs
11. JavaScript files are minified and concatenated and placed in 
	/build/publish/assets/js
12. HTML header and footer files are reverted, to include separate assets again 
	(we'll continue developing!)
13. Temporary directory that was used during the build is deleted
14. That's it!

If you add new CSS or JavaScript files you obviously need to adapt the 
build configuration. 

There are also separate tasks for optimising your PNG and JPG images. These are 
not run by default (no need to optimise images on each build!). See img.optipng 
and img.jpegtran in build.xml. On a Mac, you need to install additional software: 
Homebrew: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/, then run this in your terminal: 

brew install libjpeg optipng 

Windows binaries are already included. Source: HTML5 Boilerplate, Dependencies 
section: http://html5boilerplate.com/docs/Build-script/

Congratulations! You now have a brand new /build/publish directory that has the 
following four directories: 

* HTML files (/build/publish/html), 
* Compressed HTML files (/build/publish/html-compressed), 
* minified and concatenated CSS and JS files (/build/publish/assets), and 
* JSDoc documentation (/build/publish/docs/jsdocs). 

You can now deploy the site using your favourite Continuous Integration server. 
It could be Jenkins (http://jenkins-ci.org) or Bamboo 
(http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/). You decide. 

### To-Do: 
* Small tweaks here and there...

Thanks and good luck!
